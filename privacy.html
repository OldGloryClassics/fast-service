    <p>Last updated: February 16, 2026</p>

    <p>Old Glory Classics is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information when you use our site.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No personal data is collected automatically (no cookies, no IP logging, no trackers).</li>
        <li>We use self-hosted Matomo (or similar) for aggregate, anonymized usage stats (page views, events) with IP anonymization enabled.</li>
        <li>Ads are contextual (based on page content) — no behavioral tracking or third-party cookies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Aggregate stats help improve the service (e.g., popular channels). No data is sold or shared with third parties for marketing.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Embeds & Ads</h2>
    <p>Video embeds (Internet Archive, Vimeo, etc.) may load their own scripts. Ads are served contextually; check their policies for details.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
